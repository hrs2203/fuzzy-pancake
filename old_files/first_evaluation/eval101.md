## What does it mean?
The  task  of  measuring  sentence  similarity  is defined  as  determining  how  similar  the  meanings  of  two sentences are.
Computing sentence similarity is  not a trivial task, due to the variability of natural language -expressions. Measuring semantic similarity of sentences is closely related to semantic  similarity  between  words. It  makes  a  relationship between a word and the sentence through their meanings.The intention  is  to  enhance  the  concepts  of  semantics  over the syntactic  measures  that  are  able  to  categorize  the  pair  of sentences effectively.

## Problem We are facing.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) field has a term for this, when a word is mentioned we call it a “surface form” take for example the word “president” by itself this means the head of the country. But depending on context and time it could mean Trump or Obama.

## Current Research and methods available?
1. Sequence Similarity using Deep LSTM based Simies Network

2. Senetence prediction using by creating knowledgebase with the help of transformers.

3. Old Simple Methods
	- cosine similarity ( Embedding using WordNet )
	- path based approach (wu-palmer and shortestpath based) 
	- featurebased approach.


## Problems with current methods?
1. Computationally Expensive, yields good result.
2. Depends very much on data provided and if query asked deviates from its knowlegde space, the results are unsatisfactory.
3. Abstract approaches and need a lot of training.
	- WordNet can give very disturbing results in not monitered carefully while training.

## Possible implimentation in real world.
Semantic similarity plays a vital role in Natural  language  processing,  Informational  Retrieval,  Text Mining, Q & A systems, text-related research and application area. 

finance and legal professions as documents get lengthy and we have to resort to searching many keywords to find the right sentence or a passage.
