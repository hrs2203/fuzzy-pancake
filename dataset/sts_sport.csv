Once there was a farmer man who lived in a small village besides a nice forest.
Around his house there was a big garden where was a big apple tree alone with beautiful flowers and other trees.
The farmer spent and played most of the time with the apple tree when he was a child.
On those days The old apple tree was given a lot of choicest Apples to him.
However as time goes the tree became old and stop giving any apple.
On that time the farmer was getting no apple from the old apple tree.
He thought that this tree is useless.
So He decided to cut off the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture.
He assumed that since the tree was old and huge.
It will not give any food to eat so it is better to cut the tree and use it in a proper way.
However he forgot when he was in childhood most of the time spent climbing up and eating its apple the whole day.
Now The tree was the living place of many including sparrow squirrels and a vast number of birds and insects.
They all begging to the farmer when he came with an axe to cut the tree.
Please don’t reap the tree.
Remember the time of your childhood when we all play together around this very tree.
Without this we have no place to go.
There was a lot of noise when the farmer raised his axe to cut the apple tree without thinking those animals.
The squirrel cried out and said
Please don’t reap and destroy my litter child home
This time The Birds cried out and said
Please don’t reap and destroy my home
Again The grasshopper cried out and said
Please don’t reap and destroy my nest
The farmer has forgotten everything about his childhood and his little friends.
He started hard to cut off the tree.
To see this all they became desperate and they thought they have to protect the tree at any cost.
Those little animals said
we sang for you when you had no friends.
We look after you like a little baby in your childhood days.
He hasn’t cried instead of he felt dandy and happy to hear this.
However Their all effort and crying didn’t melt the ice of the farmer's heart.
On the other hand after doing all their request the farmer continued to reap the tree.
Suddenly a ray of lightning is coming to his face.
On inspecting it he understands that it was a beehive full of honey.
He took a small piece and put it on the mouth.
This sweet taste woke up his childhood memories and coming back slowly.
The taste of honey was so good and wanted more.
It brought happiness which was for a long time.
He smiled and exclaimed
The tastes of the honey is amazing
Finally The Farmer realizes his foolishness and then he put down his axe.
He Understands that this tree is the home of many creatures.
The Farmer realizes that maybe this tree doesn’t give any food but it was giving more than food.
This tree is the home of many animals.
For that he promised that
I will not think to cut off the tree again
You all can live in here with peace and harmony.
They all thanked the little bee to give honey if the farmer had not found the beehive at this moment they had been homeless now
